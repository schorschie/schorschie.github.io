<h1>Covid-19 Cases in Germany</h1>

<h2>Prediction</h2>

<p>I'm trying to predict the amount of hospital treatment needed to deal with the corona crisis in
germany, so that people understand, why this drastic measures are necessary.</p>

<p>The numbers are from a wikipedia article <a href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19-Fälle_in_Deutschland">
COVID-19 Fälle in Deutschland</a>.

<p>In the first step I fit a logistic curve to the current progression of infected cases and a
maximum value of 70% of Germany.</p>

The idea to use a logistic curve came from this 3Blue1Brown <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kas0tIxDvrg&t=473s">video</a>.

Second step I estimate, that 1 % of the people need intensive care for 4 days and sum up
these cases.

<h2>Contribute</h2>
<ul>
<li>Feel free to comment or contribute. I would like to access the data from some online source and 
not from my offline csv file.</li>
<li>Is there a source for the amount of people in intensive care? 1% and 3 days is just a guess.</li>
