<h1>Covid-19 Cases in Germany</h1>

<h2>Prediction</h2>

<p>I'm trying to predict the amount of hospital treatment needed to deal with the corona crisis in
Germany, so that people understand, why this drastic measures are necessary. I hope we will se a decrease of the 
curve in the near future.</p>
I do not do this to stress you, but to <em>increase the understanding</em> for the drastic measures taken now 
by the German goverment.

<h2>Disclaimer</h2>

<p>The numbers are from a wikipedia article <a href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19-Pandemie_in_Deutschland">
COVID-19 Pandemie in Deutschland</a>.

<p>In the first step I fit a logistic curve to the current progression of infected cases and a
maximum value of 70% of the population in Germany. The idea to use a logistic curve came from this
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kas0tIxDvrg&t=473s">3Blue1Brown video</a>.
Second step I estimate, that 1 % of the people need intensive care for 3 days and sum up
these cases.</p>

<p>So as you may have guessed until now, the following plot isn't scientific from any point of view.
It is just a curve fit with two parameters, and I'm even hiding the R<sup>2</sup> value.</p>

<p>For more scientific data rely on the pro's:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.rki.de/DE/Content/InfAZ/N/Neuartiges_Coronavirus/nCoV.html">Robert Koch Institut</a></li>
<li><a href="https://gisanddata.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6">Johns Hopkins University</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/germany/">Worldometer.info</a></li>
</ul>
<p>They are better in every aspect, except they don't predict the epidemic curve in public.</p>

<h2>Contribute</h2>
<ul>
<li>Feel free to comment or contribute. I would like to access the data from some online source and 
not from my offline csv file.</li>
<li>Is there a source for the amount of people in intensive care? 1% and 3 days is just a guess.</li>
</ul>

data of the RKI. I presume the time of day for the readout changed.</p>
