## Udacity

### Data Analyst

### Machine Learning Engineer

[Udacity Dog Breed Detection](https://github.com/schorschie/udacity_dog_breed)

In this project the knowledge and usage of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
is demonstrated for the Udacity reviewer team. Within this project a CNN with
the ability to detect dog breeds with an accuracy of more than 10% is created
from scratch. Afterwards a pre-trained VGG16 is adapted to perform the same task
with an accuracy of >60%. (Abstract from [Project
Report](https://github.com/schorschie/udacity_dog_breed/blob/main/project_report.pdf))

## PyPI

### [RKI Scraper](https://pypi.org/project/rki-scraper)

The RKI is the abbreviation for the German Robert Koch Institut. They are the
central science organisation consulting the German government in health issues.

They also track (count) all sick and deceased persons.

This package shall provide sick and deceased person counts for all German States
(Bundesl√§nder) and Counties (Landkreise).

It downloads the current version of the RKI csv file and parses it into a pandas
dataframe. That's about it.

## Github

### [grzegorzlippe.de](https://github.com/schorschie/schorschie.github.io)

During the lockdown of the first wave in 2020 I created this homepage for
myself. It started out as a tool to visualize the case numbers in my own
district, but then later evolved to a online CV and blog.

## Kaggle

In 2021 I started my journey on Kaggle. For now I mostly do the tutorials, but
you can follow my progress on my
[profile](https://www.kaggle.com/grzegorzlippe).
