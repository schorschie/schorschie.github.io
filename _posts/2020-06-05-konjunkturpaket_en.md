I like the German COVID-19 policy of the
[Groko](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gro%C3%9Fe_Koalition#GroKo), because it
does not only concentrate money at some big industries, but also has the common
people in mind.

We live in a social market economy. So yeah, we don't let people starve, but if
old business models die out they are (hopyfully) replaced by new ones. If we
patronize old industrie, other societies will develop the business models of the
feature (like Apple, Tesla or Amazon). In the long term it will turn Germany to
consumers.

Give me more of it! Pump money into schools (15 kids per class, good buildings,
good teachers), infrastructure (glass fiber in every village, separate cycle and
car lanes) and last but not lease sustainable energy!!! How awesome would it be,
if Germany could sustain itself with sustainable energy, the coal of the future?
