## Graduated

<!-- markdownlint-disable no-inline-html -->
Today I finished the [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com) home schooling (online university) nano
degree for [Data Analytics](https://www.udacity.com/course/data-analyst-nanodegree--nd002). I
enrolled during the Pandemic on the 24<sup>th</sup> of February and finished on the
19<sup>th</sup> of June. So the course took me roundabout 4 months, which is exactly the time
the
[Syllabus](https://d20vrrgs8k4bvw.cloudfront.net/documents/en-US/nd002-syllabus_2018-June_v9.pdf)
estimated.

I don't want to go into much detail about the syllabus of the online course, but give you an
overview of the concept of udacity. They have some free courses, so you can easily make up your
mind yourself.

The course is divided into lessons, which themselves are divided into chapters. Each learning
matter is introduced by some videos, which are followed by some multiple choice questions.

When enough material (every two to five chapters) is accumulated, then a jupyter notebook is
opened in the classroom section which can be edited online. These hands on sections also
include more complicated questions, which can only be answered, if the proper calculations
are performed in the jupyter notebook.

Each chapter is finished with a project that contains data analysis of either provided or self
chosen sources. The projects are reviewed by udacity and provided with thorough comments and
helpful remarks.

I'm happy with the result and liked the experience. But I also have to say, that some of the
topics where handled with to much detail.
