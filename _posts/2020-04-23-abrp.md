Recently I stumbled acros a fine webseite, the "better route planner"
[ABRP](https://abetterrouteplanner.com) and I tested some Tesla configurations on one of my
routes, which I would want to travel with a potential electric car.

I encourage you to also try it, because I found some really big differences in the models, which
I didn't estimate before.

I used the better route planner to calculated charging duration for a trip to Bia≈Çystok, which
I do on a regular basis. It is roundabout 1200km long.

| Tesla       | Charging Duration [h] |
|:------------|:----------------------|
| Model S 60D | 6:55                  |
| Model S 75D | 3:27                  |
| Model S 90D | 3:11                  |
| Model 3 long range RWD | 1:55       |

It is surprising to see, that the increase of capacity from 60 kWh to 75 kWh leads to half of
charging duration. I'm not sure, why that is, because the 60D can charge with 105 kW and the
75D with 120 kW.

Another surprise is, that the Model 3 is 30% faster, than the S90D.
