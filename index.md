## Professional Experience

### Systems Engineer *(since 2017)*

> Systems-Engineering  
> Bosch Corporate Research  
> Renningen & Schwäbisch Gmünd  

Ingenieur in einem bereichsübergreifendem Entwicklungsprojekt im Bosch Zentrum für
Forschung und Vorausentwicklung in Renningen.

* In dem Projekt werden Prozesse und Methoden zur simulationsbasierten
  Freigabe und statistisch belegten Modellvalidierung entwickelt.
* Das Projekt ist geschäftsbereichsübergreifend in einem agilen Setting
  organisiert.

### Calculation Engineer *(2012 -- 2017)*

> Computer Aided Engineering  
> Bosch Automotive Steering  
> Schwäbisch Gmünd  

### Project Engineer *(2010 -- 2012)*

> MesH Engineering Team  
> Work Performance at Daimler AG  
> Stuttgart  

## Education

### Data Analyst Nanodegree *(pandemic 2020)*

> This program prepares you for a career as a data analyst by helping you learn to organize
> data, uncover patterns and insights, draw meaningful conclusions, and clearly communicate
> critical findings. You’ll develop proficiency in Python and its data analysis libraries (Numpy,
> pandas, Matplotlib) and SQL as you build a portfolio of projects to showcase in your job
> search. [[Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/course/data-analyst-nanodegree--nd002)]

During the COVID-19 crisis I was short time working and invested my private time into the
Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree (and this web site). I
[finished](https://graduation.udacity.com/confirm/GMHQJMC3) the course in June. I learned how
to use jupyter notebooks, matplotlib, seaborn and most importantly the statsmodels toolbox. The
course is founded on two pillars, data analysis and results communication, both mastered with
the correct use of different hypothesis testing methods and profound usage of the plot
capabilities of python.

The project I made during the Udacity Nanodegree are hosted [github
repository](https://github.com/schorschie/udacity)

### Mechanical Engineering *(2003 -- 2009)*

> Dipl.-Ing. Automotive and Engine Engineering  
> University of Stuttgart  
> Stuttgart  

**Majors:** Vehicle dynamics and simulation technique

**Diploma Thesis:** Modelling and Simulation of an automated heavy duty gear box

I wrote my diploma thesis as an on site performer at the Daimler AG, where
I modeled and simulated a 16-gears transmission for heavy duty vehicles within
Matlab and SimulationX. The goal of the model was to increase the quality of
the application of a so called countershaft brake to reduce shift speed an jerk.

### Civil Service *(2002 -- 2003)*

> Association for the promotion of paralyzed  
> children and other disabled people e.V.  
> Nuremberg  

During my [civil service](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zivildienst) I learned
to take responsibility for me, people and my community. I helped disabled
children and frail elders by commuting them to school, for shopping or to a
doctors appointment safely, reliably and on time.

### School *(until 2002)*

> Wilhelm Löhe School  
> Nuremberg  

**A-Levels:** Qualification for university entrance with the majors in mathematics,
geography and chemistry.

At school I engaged myself as a photographer at the schools gazette and the
choir.
