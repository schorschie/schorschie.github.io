## Professional Experience

### Systems Engineer *(since 2017)*

> Systems-Engineering  
> Bosch Corporate Research  
> Renningen & Schwäbisch Gmünd  

### Calculation Engineer *(2012 -- 2017)*

> Computer Aided Engineering  
> Bosch Automotive Steering  
> Schwäbisch Gmünd  

### Project Engineer *(2010 -- 2012)*

> MesH Engineering Team  
> Work Performance at Daimler AG  
> Stuttgart  

## Education

### Data Analyst Nanodegree *(pandemic 2020)*

> This program prepares you for a career as a data analyst by helping you learn to organize
> data, uncover patterns and insights, draw meaningful conclusions, and clearly communicate
> critical findings. You’ll develop proficiency in Python and its data analysis libraries (Numpy,
> pandas, Matplotlib) and SQL as you build a portfolio of projects to showcase in your job
> search. [[Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/course/data-analyst-nanodegree--nd002)]

During the COVID-19 crisis I was short time working and invested my private time into the
Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree (and this web site). I
[finished](https://graduation.udacity.com/confirm/GMHQJMC3) the course in June. I learned how
to use jupyter notebooks, matplotlib, seaborn and most importantly the statsmodels toolbox. The
course is founded on two pillars, data analysis and results communication, both mastered with
the correct use of different hypothesis testing methods and profound usage of the plot
capabilities of python.

### Mechanical Engineering *(2003 -- 2009)*

> Dipl.-Ing. Fahrzeug- und Motorentechnik  
> Universität Stuttgart  
> Stuttgart  

**Majors:** Vehicle dynamics and simulation technique

**Diploma Thesis:** Modellbildung und Simulation eines automatisierten
Nutzfahrzeuggetriebes

I wrote my diploma thesis as an on site performer at the Daimler AG, where
I modeled and simulated a 16-gears transmission for heavy duty vehicles within
Matlab and SimulationX. The goal of the model was to increase the quality of
the application of a so called countershaft brake to reduce shift speed an jerk.

### Civil Service *(2002 -- 2003)*

> Verein zur Förderung spastisch gelähmter  
> Kinder und anderer Behinderter e.V.  
> Nürnberg  

During my civil service I learned to take responsibility for me, people and my community. I
helped disabled children and frail elders by commuting them to school, for shopping or to a
doctors appointment safely, reliably and on time.

### School *(until 2002)*

> Wilhelm Löhe Schule  
> Nürnberg  

**A-Levels:** Qualification for university entrance with the majors in mathematics,
geography and chemistry.

At school I engaged myself as a photographer at the schools gazette and the
choir.
