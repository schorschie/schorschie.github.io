{: .left_time_stamp}

### Systems Engineer

> Systems-Engineering  
> Bosch Automotive Steering GmbH  
> Schwäbisch Gmünd  

As the team's Scrum Master, I am responsible for planning, refining, and
documenting the team’s projects and progress. I additionally support the
continuous development of the team by providing the ability to use continuous
integration methods for the team.

Most valuable contributions of my side are:

* Developed the ETL process for customer time series batches from the vehicle's
  CAN traces to Bosch’s database while serving as a Data Engineer. The data base
  is currently 200 GB in size and growing.
* Developed a measurement analyzing tool and most importantly embedded it in a
  well documented continuous integration environment, so that every Bosch
  employee can contribute following the Bosch Inner Source philosophy.
* In my first Data Science Project I developed a neural net, which  clusters of
  time series data.

### NX NASTRAN

Generated a FE model analyzer with MATLAB for quality tests of NVH models:

* Analyzed script via the NASTRAN source of the model and deduced the common
  volume elements and connectors.
* Produced a Bill of Materials with images of the parts, listing density, mass,
  and stiffness which led to create a visualization of the parts and the
  connectors (springs, stiff couplings).

### VBA

Formulated a depth-first search algorithm in Visual Basic in CATIA during a
working student activity:

* Examined the structure of a cable harness utilizing a (self made) depth-first
  search algorithm.
* Automatically created a technical drawing with all connectors and cable
  lengths.

### ANSYS

Combined electrodynamic and structural mechanic within an FE model in ANSYS for
my study work:

* Calculated the electromagnetic forces on the injector through the FE mesh.
* Measured mechanical forces while moving the parts, re-meshing the injector,
  defining new initial conditions, and reiterating starting with the
  electromagnetic forces.

### Bosch Senior Data Scientist

The Bosch internal 1.5-year course give me a deep expert knowledge on Data
Science topics, with a large focus on hands-on knowledge and project work within
my department, accompanied by Bosch [BCAI](https://www.bosch-ai.com/) mentors.

The course is divided into two parts: Junior Expert and Senior Expert. Both
parts consist of a classroom training phase and a project phase. The topics
covered in the junior's classroom phase are:

* Basics of Statistics
* Statistical Learning & Gaussian Processes
* Classical Machine Learning
* Machine Learning Projects
* Deep Learning
* Advanced Deep Learning
* Time Series Analysis

And in the senior's classroom phase:

* ML Deployment
* Embedded AI
* Validation&Verification / Explainable AI
* Data Efficiency
* Option 1: Sequence Models specialization
* Option 2: Computer Vision specialization
* Foundation models
* Reinforcement Learning (optional)

### Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree

> Learn advanced machine learning techniques and algorithms and how to package
> and deploy your models to a production environment. Gain practical experience
> using Amazon SageMaker to deploy trained models to a web application and
> evaluate the performance of your models. A/B test models and learn how to
> update the models as you gather more data, an important skill in industry.
> [[Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/course/machine-learning-engineer-nanodegree--nd009t)]

I took a liking in the Udacity didactic and in scope of a Bosch/AS project I
could advance within the field of machine learning. So I took this [nano
degree](https://confirm.udacity.com/CGALRCZP) in the beginning of the year.

The capstone project, the final test for the Nanodegree in which I created and
trained an [CNN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolutional_neural_network) to
detect dog breeds with >80% accuracy is hosted in a [github
repository](https://github.com/schorschie/udacity_dog_breed).

### Data Analyst Nanodegree

> This program prepares you for a career as a data analyst by helping you learn to organize
> data, uncover patterns and insights, draw meaningful conclusions, and clearly communicate
> critical findings. You’ll develop proficiency in Python and its data analysis libraries (Numpy,
> pandas, Matplotlib) and SQL as you build a portfolio of projects to showcase in your job
> search. [[Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/course/data-analyst-nanodegree--nd002)]

During the COVID-19 crisis I was short time working and invested my private time into the
Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree (and this web site). I
[finished](https://graduation.udacity.com/confirm/GMHQJMC3) the course in June. I learned how
to use jupyter notebooks, matplotlib, seaborn and most importantly the statsmodels toolbox. The
course is founded on two pillars, data analysis and results communication, both mastered with
the correct use of different hypothesis testing methods and profound usage of the plot
capabilities of python.

The projects I made during the Udacity Nanodegree are hosted on a [github
repository](https://github.com/schorschie/udacity)

### Mechanical Engineering

> Dipl.-Ing. Automotive and Engine Engineering  
> University of Stuttgart  
> Stuttgart  

**Majors:** Vehicle dynamics and simulation technique

**Diploma Thesis:** Modelling and Simulation of an automated heavy duty gear box

I wrote my diploma thesis as an on site performer at the Daimler AG, where
I modeled and simulated a 16-gears transmission for heavy duty vehicles within
Matlab and SimulationX. The goal of the model was to increase the quality of
the application of a so called countershaft brake to reduce shift speed an jerk.

### Civil Service

> Association for humans with disabilities e.V.  
> Nuremberg  

During my [civil service](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zivildienst) I learned
to take responsibility for me, people and my community. I helped disabled
children and frail elders by commuting them to school, for shopping or to a
doctors appointment safely, reliably and on time.
