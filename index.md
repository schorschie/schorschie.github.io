systems, brake systems, corporate research, and automotive steering.
Demonstrated a clustering algorithm to estimate a valid range of a simulation
model.

* Coordinated with corporate research management in a TOP Project (top business
  value, priority, and secret) reporting directly to the top management for
  every two months.
* Acquired inclusive insights of agile methodologies as well as received scrum
  master certificate and gained knowledge as a scrum master proxy.
* Established a toolbox for a simulation and model quality framework currently
  serving within the Bosch inner source hub.

### Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree

> Learn advanced machine learning techniques and algorithms and how to package
> and deploy your models to a production environment. Gain practical experience
> using Amazon SageMaker to deploy trained models to a web application and
> evaluate the performance of your models. A/B test models and learn how to
> update the models as you gather more data, an important skill in industry.
> [[Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/course/machine-learning-engineer-nanodegree--nd009t)]

I took a liking in the Udacity didactic and in scope of a Bosch/AS project I
could advance within the field of machine learning. So I took this [nano
degree](https://confirm.udacity.com/CGALRCZP) in the beginning of the year.

The capstone project, the final test for the Nanodegree in which I created and
trained an [CNN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolutional_neural_network) to
detect dog breeds with >80% accuracy is hosted in a [github
repository](https://github.com/schorschie/udacity_dog_breed).

### Data Analyst Nanodegree

> This program prepares you for a career as a data analyst by helping you learn to organize
> data, uncover patterns and insights, draw meaningful conclusions, and clearly communicate
> critical findings. You’ll develop proficiency in Python and its data analysis libraries (Numpy,
> pandas, Matplotlib) and SQL as you build a portfolio of projects to showcase in your job
> search. [[Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/course/data-analyst-nanodegree--nd002)]

During the COVID-19 crisis I was short time working and invested my private time into the
Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree (and this web site). I
[finished](https://graduation.udacity.com/confirm/GMHQJMC3) the course in June. I learned how
to use jupyter notebooks, matplotlib, seaborn and most importantly the statsmodels toolbox. The
course is founded on two pillars, data analysis and results communication, both mastered with
the correct use of different hypothesis testing methods and profound usage of the plot
capabilities of python.

The projects I made during the Udacity Nanodegree are hosted on a [github
repository](https://github.com/schorschie/udacity)

*(2003 -- 2009)*

### Mechanical Engineering

> Dipl.-Ing. Automotive and Engine Engineering  
> University of Stuttgart  
> Stuttgart  

**Majors:** Vehicle dynamics and simulation technique

**Diploma Thesis:** Modelling and Simulation of an automated heavy duty gear box

I wrote my diploma thesis as an on site performer at the Daimler AG, where
I modeled and simulated a 16-gears transmission for heavy duty vehicles within
Matlab and SimulationX. The goal of the model was to increase the quality of
the application of a so called countershaft brake to reduce shift speed an jerk.

*(2002 -- 2003)*

### Civil Service

> Association for humans with disabilities e.V.  
> Nuremberg  

During my [civil service](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zivildienst) I learned
to take responsibility for me, people and my community. I helped disabled
children and frail elders by commuting them to school, for shopping or to a
doctors appointment safely, reliably and on time.

*(until 2002)*

### School

> Wilhelm Löhe School  
> Nuremberg  

**A-Levels:** Qualification for university entrance with the majors in mathematics,
geography and chemistry.

At school I engaged myself as a photographer at the schools gazette and the
choir.
