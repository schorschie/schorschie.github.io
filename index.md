## Education

### Mechanical Engineering *(2003 -- 2009)*

> Dipl.-Ing. Fahrzeug- und Motorentechnik  
> Universität Stuttgart  
> Stuttgart  

**Majors:** Vehicle dynamics and simulation technique

**Diploma Thesis:** Modellbildung und Simulation eines automatisierten
Nutzfahrzeuggetriebes

I wrote my diploma thesis as an on site performer at the Daimler AG, where
I modeled and simulated a 16-gears transmission for heavy duty vehicles within
Matlab and SimulationX. The goal of the model was to increase the quality of
the application of a so called countershaft brake to reduce shift speed an jerk.

### Civil Service *(2002 -- 2003)*

> Verein zur Förderung spastisch gelähmter  
> Kinder und anderer Behinderter e.V.  
> Nürnberg  

### School *(until 2002)*

> Wilhelm Löhe Schule  
> Nürnberg  

**A-Levels:** Qualification for university entrance with the majors in mathematics,
geography and chemistry.

At school I engaged myself as a photographer at the schools gazette and the
choir.
